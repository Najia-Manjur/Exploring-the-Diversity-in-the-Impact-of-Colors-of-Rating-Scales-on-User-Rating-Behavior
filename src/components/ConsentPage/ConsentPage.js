            <h5>Objective of the Study</h5>
            <p>The study may contribute to the general research area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Recommender Systems and
            Personalization. We have designed a survey that will take approximately 20 minutes and we invite you to respond to it by using 
            our system interface. The questionnaire will be presented to you after giving your consent to participate in the study.</p>
            <h5>Confidentiality</h5>
            <p>
              To protect the anonymity and confidentiality of a participant, all the collected information
              will be stored against a unique, system-generated ID. Thus, the identity of the participant will
              remain unknown. Only the researchers will have access to the ID and the information collected in the study.
            </p>
